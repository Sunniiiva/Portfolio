### 🔗 [Breaking RSA](https://github.com/Sunniiiva/QUANTUM-COMPUTING)

⚛️

Quantum computing project in python using the quiskit extention to showcase how the Quantum algorithm SHOR can theoretically break RSA encryption. RSA is based on the fact that a regular computer can't facorize large numbers effective, A quantum computer can factor numbers extremely fast and can therefore break the math behind RSA encryption.


**🔑 Key functions:** 
- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) → extracts periodicity from quantum states
- Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) → estimates the period of modular exponentiation
- Controlled Modular Multiplication → builds the modular exponentiation circuit
- Classical Post-Processing:
     - Euclidean Algorithm → computes gcd to recover prime factors
     - Continued Fractions → converts quantum phase into period estimates


**🛠️ Tech stack:**
- Languages: Python 🐍
- Libraries: Qiskit (quantum circuits, simulators, visualization)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib (plots & circuit diagrams)
- Concepts: Shor’s Algorithm, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Phase Estimation, Modular Arithmetic, RSA Cryptography

### 🔗[Key Logger](https://github.com/Sunniiiva/PYTHON/blob/main/KeyLogger/keyLogger.py)

Simple key logger coded in python for educational purposes. The program creates and stores key strokes into a text file that is being saved locally. The project was developed for educational research into endpoint threat behavior, detection and incident response workflows. It is not intended for malicious use. 
 
**🛠️ Tech stack:**
- Languages: Python 🐍
- Libraries: pynput

### 🔗[Creative Web project](https://github.com/Sunniiiva/HTML-CSS-/tree/main/Exam/EKSAMEN%20KREAW)

This project is a creative web experience built with HTML and CSS, combining storytelling and front-end design. It visualizes a fictional journey of Erna Solberg through Las Vegas on an interactive map. Users can click along her route, and each stop transitions to a new page featuring custom CSS animations, smooth transitions, and responsive layouts. 

**🛠️ Tech stack:**
- Languages: HTML
- Style sheet: CSS
