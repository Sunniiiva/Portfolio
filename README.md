### üîó [Breaking RSA](https://github.com/Sunniiiva/QUANTUM-COMPUTING)

Quantum computing project in python using the quiskit extention to showcase how the Quantum algorithm SHOR can theoretically break RSA encryption. RSA is based on the fact that a regular computer can't facorize large numbers effective, A quantum computer can factor numbers extremely fast and can therefore break the math behind RSA encryption.


**Key functions:** 
- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) ‚Üí extracts periodicity from quantum states
- Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) ‚Üí estimates the period of modular exponentiation
- Controlled Modular Multiplication ‚Üí builds the modular exponentiation circuit
- Classical Post-Processing:
     - Euclidean Algorithm ‚Üí computes gcd to recover prime factors
     - Continued Fractions ‚Üí converts quantum phase into period estimates


**Tech stack:**
- Languages: Python üêç
- Libraries: Qiskit (quantum circuits, simulators, visualization)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib (plots & circuit diagrams)
- Concepts: Shor‚Äôs Algorithm, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Phase Estimation, Modular Arithmetic, RSA Cryptography
